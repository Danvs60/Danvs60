# Hi, I'm Daniel! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I'm a Computer Science student in the UK, specialising in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My current interests are Spiking Neural Networks and NLP models (topic modelling, sentiment analysis, etc.) for linguistics analysis. I enjoy cooking (mad about pizza), and I like fitness and bouldering.
